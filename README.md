# Algorithmic Trading Winter Project - Assignment 1

## Overview

Welcome to **Assignment 1**. This assignment is designed to help you get hands-on experience with Python programming. The goal is to improve your understanding of essential Python concepts such as loops, strings, sorting, and arrays, all of which are fundamental to building algorithmic trading strategies.

## Problem Statement

The assignment consists of four tasks to improve your Python skills and prepare you for algorithmic trading.

## Requirements

1. **Python IDE**: You are required to solve this assignment in a Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook/Lab.
2. **Submission Format**: The assignment must be submitted as a **single Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`)**. Each question should have its solution in a separate code cell, with appropriate comments indicating which part answers which question.

---

## Instructions

1. **Solution Format**: 
    - Write code for each question in a separate code cell.
    - Add comments in each code block indicating which question the solution corresponds to for clarity.

2. **Important Notes**:
    - The use of AI tools like ChatGPT is discouraged. This assignment is meant to help you understand Python and develop problem-solving skills, and relying on external tools may hinder your learning.
    - The optional question (Question 4) is meant to challenge you further. Do not use conventional sorting algorithms. Think about other efficient techniques.
